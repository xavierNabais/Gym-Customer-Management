This project consists of a CRUD application for managing gym clients developed in REACT and NODE. The backend functions as an API using the REST architecture. It allows for Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on client data within the gym management system. The frontend, built with REACT, provides a user interface for interacting with the client data, while the backend, developed in NODE, serves as the server-side logic and data storage. The use of REST architecture ensures that the API endpoints adhere to the principles of statelessness, uniform interface, and client-server communication. This enables efficient and scalable communication between the frontend and backend components of the application.

Additionally, I have created comprehensive documentation for the API, detailing the endpoints, supported HTTP methods, request and response examples, authentication, error codes, and other relevant information. This documentation aims to facilitate seamless integration and usage of the API by other developers.
